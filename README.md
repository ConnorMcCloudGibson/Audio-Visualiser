# Audio-Visualiser
Software written in the JAVA language and developed using the Processing API - as part of the Computational Prototyping course,
undertaken within the faculty of Industrial Design at RMIT university in 2018. The software uses spectral and amplituted analysis of 
an audio file to control parametrisations of modifed Mauer-Rose geometric forms and a particle physics engine to generate synchronous 
visuals.
